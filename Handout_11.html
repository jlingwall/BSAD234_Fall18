    <h1>Criminal Law</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Handout 11</p>
    <section>



      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p>Chapter 10 ("Criminal Law and Cybercrime"). The chapter numbering might be slightly different in your version, but you should be able to locate the chapter on criminal law without too much trouble. Focus on the criminal procedure sections: Miranda,
        the warrant requirement, and so on.


        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> 15 minutes to finish proofing <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1olWvEeL82hHqxVL995IugX_xwohdHY-gb0PhBNn395M">short paper #2</a>. 45 minutes to do the homework, an hour for your continuous review
          of the previous material.</p>

        <p>(The outline, supplement, and videos are the same as on Handout 10, I left them here for convenient reference.) If it's helpful, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y-rQw4kCqJxaMzkJ6hejQPiGXnQtyXsJ/view" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>.
          There is also <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=140RGTGSm-v_MT2MVYwQo1A81eySkRjUi" target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>.


          <p>I also filmed two videos walking through the chapter, which you might find useful:</p>

            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll cover criminal law!

              <h2>Homework 11</h2>

              <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>


              <p>This homework asks you to look at Missouri's criminal law and parse the difference between several crimes. Be sure to pay attention to the mental state required.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>What is the difference between this <a href="http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=566.030&bid=29388&hl=">first degree</a> and <a href="http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=566.031&bid=29390&hl=">second degree</a>                  crimes?</li>
                <li>See <a href="http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneChapter.aspx?chapter=565">here</a>. What is the difference between first and second degree harassment?</li>
                <li>From the same site as (2), what is the difference between first and second degree stalking?</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Next time ....</h2>

              <p>We'll finish criminal law by studying Miranda, the exclusionary rule, qualified immunity, and exceptions to the warrant requirement.
