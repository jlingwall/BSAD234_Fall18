      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p>Chapter 2. All of this chapter is pretty important to us, because it lays a foundation for understanding the court system in the United States.

        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> one hour to read the chapter, one hour to do the homework.</p>

        <h2>Class Work</h2>
        <p>In class, we'll finish our lecture on sources of law and finding the law.

          <h2>Homework 02</h2>

          <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>

          <ol>
            <li>For Business Scenario problem 2-1 on "standing", make IRAC bullet points, as we talked through with the <em>Say Yes to the Dress</em> case in class. There, we would sketch it out something like:
              <ul>
                <li>Issue: Should the Plaintiff receive a temporary restraining order stopping the show?</li>
                <li>Rule: A temporary restraining order requires an immediate, irreparable injury.</li>
                <li>Analysis: While Plaintiff's injury is immediate, it is not irreperable, as she can simply ask others not to view the show.</li>
                <li>Conclusion: Plaintiff should not get a restraining order.</li>
              </ul>


            </li>
            <li>Be sure to read chapter 2's section on arbitration versus courts. Look at your cellphone contract. What does it say about arbitration? What are the advantages / disadvantages of this clause for the company? For you?</li>
            <li>Work Business Case Problem 2-4.</li>
            <li>Work Business Case Problem 2-9.</li>
          </ol>


          <h2>Next time ....</h2>

          <p>We'll review the history of the common law, and discuss the homework questions above.</p>
