      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p>Chapter 2. All of this chapter is pretty important to us, because it lays a foundation for understanding the court system in the United States.

        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> one hour to read the chapter, one hour to do the homework.</p>

        <h2>Class Work</h2> In class, we'll finish our lecture on sources of law and finding the law. Then we'll work on the whiteboard to show some principles from Chapter 2

        <h2>Homework 02</h2>

        <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Find a case from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Make IRAC bullet points, as we did with <em>Roe</em> in Homework 01. </li>
          <li>Look at your cellphone contract. What does it say about arbitration? What are the advantages / disadvantages of this clause for the company? For you?</li>
