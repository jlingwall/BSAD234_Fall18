    <h1>Constitutional Law</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Handout 09</p>
    <section>



      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p>Chapter 4. As we study constitutional law, I'm going to add to the book quite a bit. So pay particular attention to the slides.


        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> 60 minutes to do the homework, 60 minutes to continue with <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1olWvEeL82hHqxVL995IugX_xwohdHY-gb0PhBNn395M">short paper #2</a>.</p>

        <p>If it's helpful, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xlIxkgmmejKNhkTC7pSJWvoeYvaLcGhS/view" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=166BSkIPsIOBWxAh88DSKgfouE0-39mlk" target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>,
          <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15NWCTbNXKWGSw9GPgZLC3h0RuerbHJsQ">and amendments</a> if you feel like another take on the chapter would be useful. The slides used in class are <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YhStw5XBOic2imTMSnHNi1lIJqEFwPlkjMHvt0nQOlM">here</a>.

          <h2>Class Work</h2>
          <p> We'll cover the Fourteenth Amendment. We'll also review some writing tips for the second short paper, based on results from the first short paper. (I'll give some word choice tips, some organization tips, and give a rubric which might be instructive.)

            <h2>Homework 09</h2>

            <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>


            <p>Analyze the following situations in terms of the First Amendment. When we provided a specific test in class (such as for content-neutral speech), be sure to walk through the elements rather than talking in generalities.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Truman imposes a rule which prohibits critizing professors.</li>
              <li>Your boss at a private company says "if you criticize me, you'll lose your job."</li>
              <li>Missouri passes a law which prohibits labeling lab-grown meat as "meat".</li>
              <li>Missouri passes a law stating that all news articles must be pre-approved by a state agency before being published within the state.</li>
              <li>A parent sues a school district because a biology textbook contains material the parent finds religiously objectionable as to the creation of life on earth, claiming using a different textbook is accommodation for his religion.</li>
              <li>Suppose you wish to claim religious accommodation at work, to not be scheduled on a particular day of the week. Give an example of when this might be accommodated, and when it might not.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Next time ....</h2>

            <p>We'll start criminal law, which for our purposes will be mostly applied constitutional law.
