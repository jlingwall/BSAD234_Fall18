        <p>


          <h2>Class Work</h2>
          <p> We'll do an applied administrative law example, through studying food label regulations.

            <h2>Homework 14</h2>

            <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>


            <p>This homework will examine some administrative law concepts, and provide a little work in consumer law.</p>

            <ol>
              <li>Work problem 43-6, on whether an airline pilot was treated in an arbitrary and capricious manner.</li>
              <li>Work problem 43-8, on judicial deference to a decision about coal mining safety.</li>
              <li>Find a proposed rule on the Federal Register. Which agency proposed the rule? Which federal statute is the rule based on?</li>
              <li>Work problem 44-1, on unsolicited merchandise.</li>
              <li>Work problem 44-4, on tobacco advertisements. Assume the federal law did not provide details as to what the advertisements contained.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Next time ....</h2>

            <p>Please come to class, we'll do a class exercise on consumer labeling law together that will count as a homework.
