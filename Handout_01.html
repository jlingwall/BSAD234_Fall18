          1-7, but don't get bogged down.<label for="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-1" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote">We'll give this practice in the homework. </span>

          <h3>Law and the lemomade stand</h3>



          <p>We'll discuss the role of law in the simplest possible business: a lemonade stand. Things will get sticky pretty quickly. <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_x1OBoQbB80BaFef5v8kF0GHpKbiwb2lCw5Kr4vohYc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Slides used in class</a>            </p>

                  <h3>Finding law</h3>
                  <p>In class, we'll discuss how to find legal sources, and priority among legal sources.


                    <h2>Extra Credit</h2>
                    <p>Find a food label that could be the subject of a lawsuit, and bring it to my office hours during the first two weeks of class to discuss.



                      <h2>Homework 01</h2>

                      <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>

                        <li>Find the text of <em>Roe v. Wade</em>. Where did you find it? What does its citation mean? Does <em>stare decisis</em> mean <em>Roe</em> will always be the law? How does <em>Roe</em> build off of a case called <em>Griswold v. Connecticut?</em>
                        </li>
                        <li>Work through problem 1-1 under "Business Scenarios".</li>

                        <li>Work through the "Legal Reasoning Activity" 1-7. Answer each of the questions.</li>
                      </ol>


                      <h2>Next time ....</h2>

                      <p>We'll keep working through basics in finding and applying legal principles, quickly lecture on the basics of Chapter 2, and discuss the homework questions above.</p>
