      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p>Chapter 24. You can go quickly through this chapter, but be sure to be solid on these concepts:

        <ol>
          <li>Comity</li>
          <li>Act of State Doctrine</li>
          <li>Sovereign immunity</li>
          <li>International arbitration</li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> 30 minutes to read the chapter as above, 30 minutes to do the homework, 20 minutes to continue work on Short Paper #1, 40 minutes to start doing practice questions and review for the first exam.</p>

        <p>If it's helpful, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15upivbEDSRURJXLIVvWf4wt-xVAX-_T8/view" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. </p>

        <p>


          <h2>Class Work</h2>
          <p> We'll probe the nature and existence of international law.

            <h2>Homework 06</h2>

            <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>


            <ol>
              <li>In your own words, what is comity, why do we need it, and what is an example of it?</li>
              <li>In your own words, what is the act of state doctrine, why do we need it, and what is an example of it?</li>
              <li>In your own words, what is sovereign immunity, why do we need it, and what is an example of it?</li>
              <li>In your own words, how does arbitration under the New York Convention work, why do we need it, and what is an example of it in practice?</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Next time ....</h2>

            <p>We'll recap how the first paper went, do review for the first exam, and launch ourselves into Constitutional law.
