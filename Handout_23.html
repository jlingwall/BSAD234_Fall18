    <h1>Contract Law</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Handout 23</p>
    <section>

<p>We'll cover the formation of contracts.</p>

      <h2>Reading</h2>
<p> Your book covers these sections through a number of chapters (11-17). Given the time remaining in class, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lay4HsDetgaJVeOxV8JEYSXM1_qZzS-W">here is a reading</a>   that condenses those down a bit.
      <p>




        <!-- <p>If it's helpful, <a href="" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also a <a href=""
            target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>. -->

          <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> I would take an hour to read the chapter, half an hour to continue work on the current event paper, and half an hour to study for the midterm on torts and property law.</p>

          <p>


            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll discuss forming a contract.


              <h2>Homework 23</h2>

              <p>
None! We'll assign some once we get a bit into contracts.


                <h2>Next time ....</h2>

                <p>We'll continue with forming a contract.
