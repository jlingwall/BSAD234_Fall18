    <p class="subtitle">Handout 20</p>
    <section>

<p>We'll cover negligence and strict liability.</p>

      <h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Negligence is covered in the end of Chapter 6, and strict liability is covered in Chapter 7. If it's helpful, here is supplemental reading from <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15IaN1bkVD34QmNOYT9N6wcTrjgV2iuxT">another text.</a>
      <p>




        <!-- <p>If it's helpful, <a href="" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also a <a href=""
            target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>. -->

          <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> Two hours.  I might give an hour to do the reading, and an hour to do the homework.</p>

          <p>


            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll cover negligence together and then work examples.

    <li>Examine a local business, and suggest where there might be a liability risk for negligence.</li>
    <li>Find a warning label on a product, and comment whether (1) the label is necessary, (2) whether any additional risks from foreseeable use should be warned of. </li>
</ol>


                <h2>Next time ....</h2>

                <p>We'll review this homework, and move onto property law.
