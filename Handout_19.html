    <h1>Tort Law Part 1</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Handout 19</p>
    <section>

<p>In this lecture and homework, we'll start studying intentional torts. We'll first do intentional torts against people, then against businesses and property.</p>

      <h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Chapter 6 and <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lHJObUdpuLzRZl7ejhl1x02nlLvDFayh">one extra case</a>. If it's helpful, here is supplemental reading from <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15IaN1bkVD34QmNOYT9N6wcTrjgV2iuxT">another text.</a>
      <p>




        <!-- <p>If it's helpful, <a href="" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also a <a href=""
            target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>. -->

          <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> Two hours.  I might give an hour to do the reading, and an hour to start the homework.</p>

          <p>


            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll lecture on the background idea of torts and then go into details on specific torts.

              <h2>Homework 19</h2>
              <p> This homework will dive into intentional torts against people. The homework is <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pS7Dvb0kBuZJAj8BFX_nG1Jq8RRMBoeygbh0kwMfqHs/edit?usp=sharing">a Google Doc</a>, and the due date will depend on how fast we move through the material (likely Wednesday night).



                <h2>Next time ....</h2>

                <p>We'll continue with torts.
                </p>
