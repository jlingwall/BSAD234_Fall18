    <h1>Intellectual Property Law</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Handout 22</p>
    <section>

<p>We'll cover intellectual property.</p>

      <h2>Reading</h2>
<p>Chapter 8. I would skim the sections on patent infringment and its remedies, but be sure to get a solid grasp of copyright and trademark, including fair use.
      <p>




        <!-- <p>If it's helpful, <a href="" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also a <a href=""
            target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>. -->

          <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> I would take an hour to read the chapter, half an hour to do the homework, and half an hour to continue work on the current event paper.</p>

          <p>


            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll cover basic principles and highlights of intellectual property law.


              <h2>Homework 22</h2>

              <p>
This will be due the Monday following the Thanksgiving break.

<ol>
  <li>Briefly summarize the difference between trademark, copyright, patents, and trade secrets.</li>
  <li>If I come up with a very clever Excel spreadsheet to track personal finances, is there a way to legally protect it under either trademark, copyright, patent, or the trade secret doctrine?</li>
  <li>Using the <a href="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/cases/">Stanford Fair Use Case index</a>  , find two cases that seem interesting and summarize the decision.</li>
  <li>Listen, or read the transcript, to NPR's <a href="https://www.thisamericanlife.org/441/when-patents-attack">When Patents Attack</a>. Explain why the article is correct, or incorrect about the role of patents.   </li>
</ol>

                <h2>Next time ....</h2>

                <p>We'll continue with intellectual property.
                </p>
