      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p>Chapter 4. As we study constitutional law, I'm going to add to the book quite a bit. So pay particular attention to the slides.


        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> 30 minutes to read the chapter, and an hour and a half to study for the first mini-midterm.</p>

        <p>If it's helpful, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xlIxkgmmejKNhkTC7pSJWvoeYvaLcGhS/view" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=166BSkIPsIOBWxAh88DSKgfouE0-39mlk" target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>,
          <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15NWCTbNXKWGSw9GPgZLC3h0RuerbHJsQ">and amendments</a> if you feel like another take on the chapter would be useful. The slides used in class are <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YhStw5XBOic2imTMSnHNi1lIJqEFwPlkjMHvt0nQOlM">here</a>.
        </p>

          <h2>Class Work</h2>
          <p> We'll do some review for the first test, and then dive into the text, history, and structure of the Constitution, with particular emphasis on the commerce clause and the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

            <h2>Homework 07</h2>

            <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>


            <ol>
              <li>None, please use time to study for the first midterm.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Next time ....</h2>

            <p>We'll continue with our lecture on Constitutional law.
