<p>We'll cover the four UCC warranties for sale of goods.</p>

      <h2>Reading</h2>
<p> Chapter 23. Read this one pretty closely.
      <p>




        <!-- <p>If it's helpful, <a href="" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also a <a href=""
            target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>. -->

          <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> I would take an hour to read the chapter, and an hour to do the homework.</p>

          <p>


            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll work through the theory of warranty law, and do a number of examples.


              <h2>Homework 24</h2>

              <p>
<em>This final homework reviews contract formation. It will be due Friday December 7th at 11pm.</em>
    <p>
During Lady Gaga’s halftime performance at the Super Bowl, Tom (a Patriot’s fan) becomes despondent. As being despondent generally makes Tom hungry, and not wanting to miss more of the game, he posted the following message on Facebook: “I’ll give $100 for a pizza delivered to my house.”
    <p>
Ariel sees the message, and texts “I’ll do it” to Tom. She then goes to the store and gets a frozen pizza.
    <p>
Brady sees the message, quickly buys a fresh pizza, and shows up at Tom’s door before Ariel. Tom, who dislikes Brady, says “Oh I was just joking” and shuts the door.
    <p>
Cindy, who is watching the game with Tom, says “Fine, Tom, I’ll go get a pizza.” Tom, now that the game is in the early third quarter, has grown increasingly frustrated. He picks up a Vince Lombardi trophy replicate and gestures menacingly with it, saying “Oh yes you will.” Cindy, looking frightened, leaves the apartment.
    <p>
Ariel finally shows up at Tom’s door, but Tom sees the frozen pizza and dashes it the ground. Ariel leaves in tears. Dan, Tom’s roommate, says “I was going to share that pizza! Why would you do that?”
    <p>
After the game is over, Tom is so excited that he forgets all thoughts of hunger and dedicates his life to serving the poor.
    <p>
<em>Assuming only the common law applies, who has enforceable contractual rights?</em>



                <h2>Next time ....</h2>

                <p>We'll wrap up the class.
