      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p>Chapter 4. As we study constitutional law, I'm going to add to the book quite a bit. So pay particular attention to the slides.


        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> 30 minutes to keep reading the chapter, 45 minutes to do the homework, 45 minutes to start <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1olWvEeL82hHqxVL995IugX_xwohdHY-gb0PhBNn395M">short paper #2</a>.</p>

        <p>If it's helpful, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xlIxkgmmejKNhkTC7pSJWvoeYvaLcGhS/view" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=166BSkIPsIOBWxAh88DSKgfouE0-39mlk" target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>,
          <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15NWCTbNXKWGSw9GPgZLC3h0RuerbHJsQ">and amendments</a> if you feel like another take on the chapter would be useful. The slides used in class are <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YhStw5XBOic2imTMSnHNi1lIJqEFwPlkjMHvt0nQOlM">here</a>.
        </p>

          <h2>Class Work</h2>
          <p> We'll keep doing the First Amendment

            <h2>Homework 08</h2>

            <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>


            <ol>
              <li>Using your finely-honed online research skills, study the Supreme Court case <em>United States v. Morrison</em>, 529 U.S. 598 (2000). This is a famous commerce clause case about the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. What are the three
                ways in which Congress can regulate interstate commerce?</li>
              <li>Again using <em>Morrison</em>, what did the Supreme Court conclude about the Act and the Commerce Clause? </li>
              <li>How did the dissenting justices in <em>Morrison</em> disagree with the majority? </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Next time ....</h2>

            <p>We'll continue with our lecture on Constitutional law.
