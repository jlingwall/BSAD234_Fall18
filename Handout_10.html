      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p>Chapter 10 ("Criminal Law and Cybercrime"). The chapter numbering might be slightly different in your version, but you should be able to locate the chapter on criminal law without too much trouble. Focus on the criminal procedure sections: Miranda,
        the warrant requirement, and so on.


        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> 45 minutes to read the chapter, 30 minutes to do the homework below, 45 minutes to continue work on <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1olWvEeL82hHqxVL995IugX_xwohdHY-gb0PhBNn395M">short paper #2</a>.
          Recall, the marginal benefit of at least one edit exceeds its cost!</p>

        <p>If it's helpful, <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y-rQw4kCqJxaMzkJ6hejQPiGXnQtyXsJ/view" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=140RGTGSm-v_MT2MVYwQo1A81eySkRjUi" target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>.


          <p>I also filmed two videos walking through the chapter, which you might find useful:</p>

            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll cover criminal law!

              <h2>Homework 10</h2>

              <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>


              <p>This homework finishes up Constitutional Law by applying the 14th Amendment in three Equal Protection situations:</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Suppose Kirksville passes an ordinance limited food trucks to those with existing licenses, so getting a new food truck in town is impossible. Does this violate the Equal Protection Clause? (By treating new versus old food vendors differently?)</li>
                <li>Suppose Missouri passed a law segregating public schools on the basis of religion. Does this violate the Equal Protection Clause?</li>
                <li>Suppose Truman decided to limit enrollment to men only. Does this violate the Equal Protection Clause?</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Next time ....</h2>

              <p>We'll start criminal law, which for our purposes will be mostly applied constitutional law.
