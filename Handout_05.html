      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p>Chapter 5. The most important part is the discussion of ethical frameworks mid-chapter. You should know the difference between religion-based ethics, duty-based ethics, Kant's categorical imperative, and so on.

        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> 45 minutes to read the chapter as above, 45 minutes to do the homework, 20 minutes to continue work on Short Paper #1, 10 minutes for your continuous review.</p>

        <p>If it's helpful, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14dIREfKsgn9DymO1HJ1TbbEWu8VEpRTXm7H_WeOswDs/edit" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a> </p>


        <p> If you want some extra review reading, see <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bxb14OQixVf9Z1NUOEFvSDN4RUllcW0tV1RLYVZNa0JsNmRn/view" target="_blank">here</a>. This is from a Truman-student written textbook covering the material in our course.



          <h2>Class Work</h2>
          <p> We'll walk through some big ideas in business ethics, particularly as to what duties corporations may owe the world.

            <h2>Homework 05</h2>

            <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>


            <ol>
              <li>In your own words, what is Kant’s “categorical imperative”?
              </li>
              <li>Give an example of how someone might apply the categorical imperative in practice.</li>
              <li>How does someone who follows utilitarianism make ethical decisions?</li>
              <li>How does someone who follows a “principles of rights” ethical framework make decisions?</li>
              <li>Using the Say Yes to the Dress case discussed in class, show how someone using the four ethical frameworks from Chapter 5 § 3 would evaluate the situation. For example, would the categorical imperative suggest suing about this? Did the show
                violate a principle of rights?
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Next time ....</h2>

            <p>We'll cover international law to round out the introductory section of the class. At this point, we'll have a foundation of what American law is, where it comes from, how it relates to ethics, alternate dispute resolution, and international
              law.
