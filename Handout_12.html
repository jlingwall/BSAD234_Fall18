    <p class="subtitle">Handout 12</p>
    <section>



      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p> Chapter 46. (Recall, this might be numbered differently in your book, look at the section headings which should read 46.) Read the first four sections closely, except you can skip the example cases. Skim sections 5 and 6, on exemptions and international
        antitrust.


        <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> 90 minutes to read the chapter closely as suggested above, 30 minutes to finish the criminal law homework below.</p>

        <p>If it's helpful, <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vjAcR90ovYhN7Te_TsIYxDN_isTybfwr" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15QCZHFU7dsAsLa9mnUP4cy0ilCYefIzO" target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>.





          <p>


            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll cover antitrust law!

              <h2>Homework 12</h2>

              <p>Working with groups is encouraged. Designate someone to turn in a single copy, with all group members' names, on Blackboard.</p>


              <p>This homework will cover warrant requirement exceptions and Miranda.</p>

              <ol>
                <li>Work through 10-7, the pitbull case on the warrant requirement.</li>
                <li>Find the original case <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em>. What are the facts of the original case? </li>
                <li>If you are asked to come in for a student conduct hearing at Truman, must you be read Miranda rights before being questioned?</li>
              </ol>

              <h2>Next time ....</h2>

              <p>Depending on how far we get, we'll either finish antitrust or move into administrative law.
