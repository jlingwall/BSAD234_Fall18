      <h2>Reading</h2>
<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zcnotIfeHsrrsX5e5MayhDblqjUcFEu9_99xhP13K9U/edit">Spend some time on this, or you might be lost in class.</a>
      <p>




        <!-- <p>If it's helpful, <a href="" target="_blank">here is a chapter outline</a>. There is also a <a href=""
            target="_blank">student-created supplement on the text</a>. -->

          <p><em>Suggested (minimum!) time use:</em> Two hours.  I might give 45 minutes to the reading, and 75 minutes to do the homework after class.</p>

          <p>


            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll start a lecture on business organizations. We'll walk quickly through the major business entities, with their advantages and disadvantages.

              <h2>Homework 18</h2>
              <p> This homework will start you into the process and problems with organizing a business. It will be due Wednesday night at 11:00pm.

                <ol>
<li>What are the major benefits and costs of operating a sole proprietorship? </li>

<li> Harry, Hermione, and Ron decide to form a business selling magic tricks. Harry and Hermione will manage the business, and will assume liability for the business. Ron (who recently won the lottery) will chip in funds, and will review the companyâ€™s books every now and then. What kind of business are they attempting to form, and why?</li>
<ol type="a">
  <li> A limited partnership</li>
  <li> An LLC</li>
  <li> A general partnership</li>
  <li> A corporation  </li>
</ol>
<li>Would you advise the trio differently?</li>

<li> Larry, Curly, and Moe are partners. Larry and Curly work part-time on partnership business, while Moe puts in around 80 hours a week. Moe contributed $20,000 to partnership capital, while Larry and Curly each contributed $100,000. In addition, Moe is responsible for bringing in over half of the partnership's business. If these three have formed a general partnership, who is in charge?
<ol type="a">
<li> Moe, because he works the most.
<li> Larry and Curly equally because they contributed the most.
<li> Each equally.
<li> Moe, because he brings in the most business.
</ol>

<li>Besides choosing a legal structure and filing any required documents, what new steps should a business take in practice? Think broadly.</li>
<li>Your friend wants to start a lawn-care edging business in Kirksville, called Kirksville Fringe Cutting (KFC). You've advised him an LLC might be his best option for limited liability. What advice do you give him to help prevent his personal liability?</li>
<li>Make a table. On the rows, list the business entities discussed in class. For columns, include "liability rules", "how to form", and "major advantages and disadvantages". Fill in the cells of the table.</li>





                </ol>

                <h2>Next time ....</h2>

                <p>We'll continue with business organizations by walking through some of the homework, doing a practical example, and examining litigation against an LLC.
                </p>
