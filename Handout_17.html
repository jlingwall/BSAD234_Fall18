      <h2>Reading</h2>


      <p> Chapters 34 and 35. Make sure to know a bit about the major federal employment laws, and then study the employment discrimination material in depth. This will be the reading for most of next week as we work through employment law.

            <h2>Class Work</h2>
            <p> We'll keep working through employment law.

              <h2>Homework 17</h2>
              <p> We're going to revisit the cases we discussed in class--the cases are key in this chapter, as they reinforce administrative and criminal law principles and teach environmental law.

                <ol>
                  <li>Work through Question 2 following the <em>Friends of the Animals</em> case. </li>
                  <li>In <em>United States v. O'Malley</em>, the mental state in the statute at issue was "knowingly violate."
                    <ol type="a">


                      <li>How did O'Malley satisfy this mental state?</li>
                      <li>If the mental state had been strict liability, would O'Malley have been convicted?</li>
                      <li>If the mental state had been specific intent, would O'Malley have been convicted? (Make any assumptions you need based on the text of the case to take a stance one way or the other.)</li>
                  </li>

                </ol>
                <li>At the end of the <em>Riverkeeper</em> case, answer the two Critical Thinking questions. </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Next time ....</h2>

                <p>We'll continue employment law.
                </p>
